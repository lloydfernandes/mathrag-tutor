📚 Local RAG Math Tutor (Offline Chatbot)

A fully offline, local chatbot that answers math questions by retrieving relevant examples from a custom knowledge base using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and a locally running LLM via Ollama.
 
🚀 Features
	•	🧠 RAG-powered: Retrieves real math examples to ground its answers.
	•	🧩 Uses local LLMs: No internet, no OpenAI API needed.
	•	🧾 Your own knowledge base: Add math problems in .txt files.
	•	⚡️ Fast + Private: Everything runs locally using ChromaDB and Ollama.
	•	💬 Streamlit interface: Simple web app for interaction.

🧠 How It Works
	1.	Loads math problem files from data/gsm8k/
	2.	Splits and embeds them using sentence-transformers
	3.	Stores embeddings in a local Chroma vector store
	4.	Uses retrieval to fetch similar examples for any user query
	5.	Feeds query + context into a local LLM like mistral via Ollama
	6.	Answers with contextually grounded reasoning

⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repo

git clone git@github.com:lloydfernandes/mathrag-tutor.git
cd mathrag-tutor

2. Set Up a Conda Environment

conda create -n mathrag python=3.10
conda activate mathrag

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Install & Start Ollama

Download Ollama from https://ollama.com

Then run a local model:

ollama run mistral
# or
ollama run qwen:7b

5. Add Math Problems

Put your .txt math problems in:

data/gsm8k/

Example (problem1.txt)

Question: Jane has 3 apples. She buys 4 more. How many apples does she have now?
Answer: 3 + 4 = 7. Jane has 7 apples.

6. Run the App

streamlit run main.py

Open the app in your browser: http://localhost:8501


💡 Customization Tips
	•	📄 Add more .txt files to make your tutor smarter.
	•	🧪 Use made-up facts (like “Mars capital is Cheesetown”) to test RAG.
	•	🔒 Toggle “strict mode” (coming soon) to force the LLM to use only the context.


🧪 Example Questions to Try

A boy had 5 candies. He ate 2. How many are left?
What is the capital of Mars?  <-- test custom data
A train leaves at 3PM and arrives at 7PM. How long was the journey?
